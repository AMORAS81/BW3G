# Black and White 3: Genesis

This is a project based on [pokecrystal](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal).
To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Discussion is on [PokéCommunity](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=421687)
and the `#bw3-genesis` channel of the [Polished Crystal Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZK5pqK8).

This game takes place in Unova, a handful of years after the events of Black2/White2, with a new plot, and new take on traversing the region. As an unofficial "sequel" to B2/W2, this game primarily uses mechanics from Gen 5, though with some from Gen 6, as it is set as somewhat of a midway point between the two generations.

Features include:

- 253 Pokémon available, with a mixture of Pokémon from the first 5 generations (and 1 from Gen 6)
- 255 moves, with a variety of selections across the first 5 generations (plus a few from Gen 6)
- Fairy type has been introduced in this game
- Physical/Special split for attacks is implemented
- TMs are infinitely reusable
- Running Shoes available from the start by holding B
- Repels can be re-activated instantly

Credits to:

- COMBOY for the collection of in-battle sprites
- Solo993 for some of the trainer sprites, with some edits by me
- Custom music by Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, FroggestSpirit, TriteHexagon, Regen, and myself
- Rangi for the highly in-depth pokecrystal tutorials (and for making Polished Map) without which this hack would not be possible
