# Instructions

Download the **BW3G** source files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AzureKeys/BW3G
cd BW3G
```

Build **bw3genesis.gbc**:
 
```bash
make
```

You will need [**rgbds**](https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds) **0.4.2**. If you have installed a different version, put the 0.4.2 files in a subdirectory of BW3G named `rgbds`.
